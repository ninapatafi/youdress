# Project Title

YouDress

## Overview

YouDress is a virtual fashion retail storefront that employs a 'dress up doll' feature so users can visually plan an outfit to purchase. Whether they're considering a new piece to go with their exisiting collection or buying a whole new outfit, their customized doll will alow them to unleash their creativity and consider various styling options. This is a fun way for users to filter out products to find and purchase new wardrobe pieces.

### Problem

When purchasing clothing online, the only way to visually conceptualize your future outfit is to consider the model in product photos and the list of clothing items in your shopping cart. Rather than having to put the outfit together once the user's pieces arrive in the mail, YouDress encourages the user to conceptualize how these pieces would fit together in a new or existing wardrobe before ordering.
YouDress attempts to bring the physical "try-on" experience found in a physical retailer, to a digital storefront, albeit in a more stylized and abstract way.
